# Preprocessing Unstructured Data for LLM Applications  

## Project Description  
This project focuses on **preprocessing unstructured data** from various document types, including:  
**PDF**  
**Word (.docx)**  
**Excel (.xlsx)**  
**PowerPoint (.pptx)**  
**EPUB**  
**HTML**  

After extraction, the structured data is used as context for a transformers-based QA model. 

## How to Run the Code  

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Install Dependencies  
Before running the script, ensure you have all the required Python libraries:  
**Document**
**Presentation**
**BeautifulSoup**
**transformers import pipeline**
**pdfplumber**
**pytesseract**
**PIL import Image**
**os**
**json**

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Run the Preprocessing Notebook
Execute the Jupyter Notebook to process files and extract structured data:
 **Jupyter notebook preprocessing.ipynb**

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Extracted Data Output
 **The extracted text and metadata will be saved in the output/ folder in JSON format.**

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Using the RAG Pipeline
 **After preprocessing, the extracted text can be used as input for a Question-Answering (QA) model using the transformers' pipeline.**
